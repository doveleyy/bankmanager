## Introduction
This is my first ever project! My aim was to create a bank interface in the command line to learn the basics of databases and SQL.

## Technologies Used
C++ 17
SQLite3

## Overview
This project's primary objective was to utilise a simple relational database to learn how to design a basic structure for a database and use SQL to query the database to modify and read the data. A user is able to create their user account and bank accounts to deposit and transfer money between accounts.
